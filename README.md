# restaurant-accounting-and-tips-distribution
## Description
This program is designed to help with the day-to-day accounting for restaurants, especially calculatation of tip distribution.
It was written during Summer in 2022, when I was working full-time in an extremely short-staffed restaurant where the waitors had to do the accounting when closing the restaurant at the end of the day and all of us were struggling with the calculations.
It is a very simple program and was mainly meant to exercise the python programming skills that I learnt from COMP 202 course at McGill. It definitely has lots of limitations. The lack of a GUI made its accessibility difficult to my co-works and was thus not very helpful for their accounting.

## How to use
1. Download both honihoni-money_counting.py and honihoni.py and save them in the same folder.
2. Open Terminal, direct to the folder in which the files are saved, run honihoni-money_counting.py
